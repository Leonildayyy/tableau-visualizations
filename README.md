# Tableau Portfolio

This repository showcases a series of Tableau dashboards I built while completing the **Tableau A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training for Data Science (Udemy)** course.  
The visualizations are based on real-world style datasets and cover a variety of business use cases, including:

- **Customer Scatter Plot** – Sales vs. Profit by Customer with Profit Margin coloring  
- **Target Achievement Analysis** – Monthly targets vs. actual performance, including variance analysis  
- **Category Performance** – Sales vs. Target broken down by product categories  
- **Unemployment Trends** – UK unemployment by age group (stacked area chart)  

Each dashboard demonstrates data storytelling through visualization, focusing on clarity, interactivity, and business insights.
